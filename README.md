# TrashBack Prototype

TrashBack is a behavioral prototype demonstrating incentive-based waste disposal. It uses a Scan → Dispose → Reward loop to encourage responsible plastic disposal.

## Demo Assumptions
- Codes are simulated
- Disposal confirmation is assumed
- Rewards are symbolic

> [!IMPORTANT]
> TrashBack is a behavioral prototype demonstrating incentive-based waste disposal, not a real recycling system.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: User interface for scanning and rewards.
- `admin.html`: Admin dashboard for global statistics.
- `style.css`: Visual styling and design system.
- `script.js`: User-side application logic.
- `admin.js`: Admin-side dashboard logic.

## Technical Details
- Built with Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.
- Data is persisted using `localStorage`.

## Demo Flow
1. Explain real-life trigger (₹5 cashback bottle story).
2. Enter a sample plastic code in the user interface.
3. Show points increase and disposal history.
4. Open the admin dashboard to see global increments.
5. Conclude: "We didn’t change awareness. We changed incentives."
